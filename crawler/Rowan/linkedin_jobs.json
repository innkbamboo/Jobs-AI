Check it out here: https://www.loom.com/share/5a8972c7fbbf46aaa3f389b2b6391c40\nOverviewYou\u2019ll join an expert annotation team to create training data for the world's most advanced AI models. No previous AI experience is necessary. You'll get your foot in the door with one of the most prominent players in the AI/LLM space today. We seek software engineers with 3+ years of experience to train large AI language models, helping cutting-edge generative AI models write better code. Projects typically include discrete, highly variable problems that involve engaging with these models as they learn to code. We currently have 200+ roles open!\nWhat Will I Be Doing?Evaluating the quality of AI-generated code, including human-readable summaries of your rationaleSolve coding problems, writing functional and efficient codeWriting robust test cases to confirm code works efficiently and effectivelyWe asked the technical project manager to go into even more detail and this is how he answered: It is solving coding challenges, creating instructions to help others, reviewing the code before it goes into the model, and there's a ton of variety in the projects. We have everything from \"Which piece of Golang code is better?\" to \"Make a full mobile application using this chatbot, and improve the chatbot's responses afterward to make it faster.\"\nPay RatesCompensation rates vary based on location and experience.Note: The following rates are starting points and may be subject to change:To view the complete list of locations and their values, click here.US - 50/hrBrazil - 25.40 USD /hrEgypt - 14.60 USD /hrPhilippines - 24.20 USD /hrExpectations are 15+ hours per week; however, there is no upper limit.

You'll get paid weekly per hour of work done on the platform.\nContract LengthLong term, there is no end date. They expect to have work for the next 2 years.You can end the contract at any time. We hope you will commit to 12 months of work, but if you start and it's not a fit for you, we totally understand.\nFlexible SchedulesDevelopers can set their own hours\u2014ideal candidates will be interested in spending 40 hours a week. They will be with teams, so strong performers will adapt to the urgency of projects and stay engaged, but they will also be incredibly flexible on working hours.You can take a 3-hour lunch, no problem. Instead of tracking your hours, you are paid according to time spent on the platform, calculated in the coding exercises.\nInterview ProcessApply using this Ashby form.If you seem like a good fit, we'll send an async RLHF code review that will take 35 minutes and must be finished within 72 hours of us sending it.You'll receive credentials to the RLHF platform. We'll then set up a group call to answer any further questions about onboarding with the company.You'll perform a simulated production-level task (RLHF task) on the platform. This will be your final interview, which will ultimately determine your employment and leveling. Successful completion of this process provides you with an opportunity to work on projects as they become available.\nTech Stack PrioritiesThe current priority for this team is engineers with either a Data Science background who know Golang well or software engineers who are well versed in Golang.\nRequired Qualifications:3+ years of experience in a software engineering/software development role.Complete fluency in the English language.Ability to articulate complex scientific concepts clearly and engagingly.Excellent attention to detail and ability to maintain consistency in writing.Solid understanding of grammar, punctuation, and style guidelines.Proficiency with Golang\nNice To Haves:Bachelor's or Master\u2019s degree in Computer ScienceProficiency in working with one or more of the following: Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, C++.
